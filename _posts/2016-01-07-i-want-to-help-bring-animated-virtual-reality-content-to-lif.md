I want to help bring animated Virtual Reality content to life.

I believe VR will change the way we consume media, entertainment and how we learn.

In 2016 I will continue to collaborate with artists, writers, animators and programmers to bring content to life in ways that will provoke emotion and leave lasting impressions on our viewers.

As an animator and a producer, my passion is building teams and inspiring them to make great things. Whether the team member is local or abroad, I truly enjoy helping to bring their best work to life.
